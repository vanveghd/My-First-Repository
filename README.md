# **My First Repository**
***
  
Thank you for visiting my first GitHub repository!
### **Who am I?**
  
I am an M.Sc. Candidate in the School of Earth, Environment and Society at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). I work in the School of Earth, Environment and Society's Transportation Research Lab under Dr. Darren Scott, and conduct my research in the fields of active transportation, bikesharing and urban geography, using GIS, and Big Data. 

### **What is the purpose of this repository?**
  
The purpose of this particular repository is to serve as the main branch/collection of updates to my coursework within the School's _Reproducible Research Workflow with GitHub and R_ graduate course. The aim of the course is to promote openness and reproducibility in research, using open-source tools for managing documentation, code, and version control. The particular software tools of focus in the course are GitHub (online and Desktop) and `R`. 
  
The majority of the course assignments, practice examples and activities will be placed and updated within this repository throughout the Fall 2021 term.
